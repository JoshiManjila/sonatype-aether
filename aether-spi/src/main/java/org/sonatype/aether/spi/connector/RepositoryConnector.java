/**
 * A connector for a remote repository. The connector is responsible for downloading/uploading of artifacts and metadata
 * from/to a remote repository. Besides performing the actual transfer and recording any exception encountered in the
 * provided upload/download objects, a connector must also use
 * {@link Transfer#setState(org.sonatype.aether.spi.connector.Transfer.State)} to update the state of a transfer during
 * its processing. Furthermore, the connector must notify any {@link org.sonatype.aether.transfer.TransferListener
 * TransferListener} configured on its associated {@link org.sonatype.aether.RepositorySystemSession
 * RepositorySystemSession}. If applicable, a connector should obey connect/request timeouts and other relevant settings
 * from the configuration properties of the repository system session. While a connector itself can use multiple threads
 * internally to performs the transfers, clients must not call a connector concurrently, i.e. connectors are generally
 * not thread-safe.
